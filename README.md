# machine.learning

This project is a collection of common tasks in Data Science and Machine Learning projects. Help with dimensionality reduction, swarm optimization, among others.

Using a lot of different algorithms, techniques, and approaches all of them based on Python and R languages. Also, all solutions are presented in a note book allowing for reproducibility.
